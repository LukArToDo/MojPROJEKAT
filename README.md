# MojPROJEKAT

As part of the learning process, I worked on this project: Accounting and business program for company Maxpapir.

Some initial ideas:
    
   
   - GUI: JavaFX
        - Sensitive to movement and mouse click 
   - database: MySQL
        - Automatically saves backup data every first Monday of the month
        - manual data backup
        - manually resetting data from previously backed up data
   - converting some views to a PDF file (travel order, invoice, etc.)
   - posting a bank statement: manually and automatically (by importing directly from mail-inbox, converting PDF files to usable data)
   - sending invoices with a stamp and signature in a PDF file directly to the customer
   - a subprogram for making travel orders, wages
   - change of background (4 types) with F12 key
   - use of a built-in calculator with the F11 key
   - financial analysis of business operations
